## Dockerfile
A Dockerfile is a simple text-file that contains a list of commands that the Docker client calls while creating an image. It's a simple way to automate the image creation process. The best part is that the commands you write in a Dockerfile are almost identical to their equivalent Linux commands. This means you don't really have to learn new syntax to create your own dockerfiles.

So first we'll create a Dockerfile. To start, create a new blank file in our favorite text-editor and save it in the same folder as the flask app (app.py file in the 4-dockerfiles folder) by the name of Dockerfile.

We start with specifying our base image. Use the FROM keyword to do that -

```Dockerfile
FROM python:3-onbuild
```

The next step usually is to write the commands of copying the files and installing the dependencies. Luckily for us, the onbuild version of the image takes care of that. The next thing we need to specify is the port number that needs to be exposed. Since our flask app is running on port 5000, that's what we'll indicate.

```Dockerfile
EXPOSE 5000
```

The last step is to write the command for running the application, which is simply - python ./app.py. We use the CMD command to do that -

```Dockerfile
CMD ["python", "./app.py"]
```

The primary purpose of CMD is to tell the container which command it should run when it is started. With that, our Dockerfile is now ready. This is how it looks like -

```Dockerfile
# our base image
FROM python:3-onbuild

# specify the port number the container should expose
EXPOSE 5000

# run the application
CMD ["python", "./app.py"]
```

Now that we have our Dockerfile, we can build our image. The docker build command does the heavy-lifting of creating a Docker image from a Dockerfile.

The section below shows you the output of running the same. Before you run the command yourself (don't forget the period), make sure to replace my username with yours. This username should be the same one you created when you registered on Docker hub. If you haven't done that yet, please go ahead and create an account. The docker build command is quite simple - it takes an optional tag name with -t and a location of the directory containing the Dockerfile.

```
$ docker build -t prakhar1989/catnip .

```

If you don't have the python:3-onbuild image, the client will first pull the image and then create your image. Hence, your output from running the command will look different from mine. Look carefully and you'll notice that the on-build triggers were executed correctly. If everything went well, your image should be ready! Run docker images and see if your image shows.

The last step in this section is to run the image and see if it actually works (replacing my username with yours).

```
$ docker run -p 8888:5000 prakhar1989/catnip
 * Running on http://0.0.0.0:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

The command we just ran used port 5000 for the server inside the container, and exposed this externally on port 8888. Head over to the URL with port 8888, where your app should be live.

Congratulations! You have successfully created your first docker image.
